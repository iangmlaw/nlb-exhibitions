“Opinions expressed belong solely to the presenters and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Library Board.” Unfortunately, the news reports we encounter rarely come with disclaimers. How, then, can we discern opinion, fact and fabrication in news reporting?

Secrets from the National Library’s exhibition _“The News Gallery: Beyond Headlines”_ are revealed as __Librarians Faridah Ibrahim and Mazelan Anuar__ share their observations on the current trends in news media. Gain valuable insights into fake news and learn how to differentiate between what’s real and what’s not.
