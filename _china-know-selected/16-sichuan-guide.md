[**Chengdu: A rising economic star in western China**](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=200172471){:target="_blank"}

Chengdu, one of the main beneficiaries of the government’s policies to develop west China, has also attracted foreign investors due to its relatively cheap labour and land costs. However, Chengdu’s economy is still rather small and faces stiff competition from both domestic and international quarters. This publication profiles Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan, detailing examples of economic transformations the city has undergone over the last decade.
