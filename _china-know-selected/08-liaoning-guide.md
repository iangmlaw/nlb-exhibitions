[**A report from the rustbelt**](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/Main/Browse?startsWith=E){:target="_blank"}

Findings from this report show that local officials are searching for new economic policy directions to help the Liaoning province recover from an economic slump and encouraging local companies to reform. The province still faces several challenges such as debt-financing problems for many local companies and the brain-drain phenomenon with graduates re-locating to Beijing and southern China for better job prospects. This research report is the result of a field study undertaken by The Economist Intelligence Unit to Liaoning in north-eastern China.
