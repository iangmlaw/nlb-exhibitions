    section-subtitle: "On Paper : Singapore Before 1867"
    section-description: |
      On Paper : Singapore Before 1867 features over 150 paper-based artefacts that tell the story of Singapore’s early history – from a 17th-century Portuguese navigational chart that points to the existence of a Shahbandar (harbour master) on Singapore island to the key document that established the Straits Settlements as a Crown Colony of Britain on 1 April 1867.
      
      Through carefully preserved records from the collections of the National Library, National Archives of Singapore and overseas institutions, On Paper presents a rare treat to all who are interested in our nation’s past.
