Cotton is at the heart of India’s textile industry. Indian dyed and painted cottons were admired and traded to the Far East and the Mediterranean for many generations before European interest in chintz created a new market. Considered as one of the world’s leading private collectors on textile art from the Indian Subcontinent, Karun Thakar has amassed items from the 14th century through to the early 20th century.
