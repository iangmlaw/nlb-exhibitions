Discover the story of India’s railways from its beginnings to the present day, and trace their role in Indian history and the creation of today’s modern state. The first railway line was completed in 1853 and fewer than 100 years later, in 1929, 41,000 miles of track already served the country. The Indian people quickly took to the railways, as the trains allowed them to travel easily for the first time. The Indian Railways network remains one of the largest in the world, serving over 25 million passengers each day.
