_Step into the world of Malay stories – fantastical adventure tales of kings and heroes, founding myths of sultanates, and romantic poetry._

For centuries, Malay was the language of trade, diplomacy, religious discourse, and literature for maritime Southeast Asia. This exhibition explores traditional Malay literature captured in ink on paper – from handwritten manuscripts to early lithographed books.

These rarely seen items provide glimpses into the society that produced and read these literary works. Discover lesser-known stories of women authors and 19th-century lending libraries in the Malay world. Learn about the dramatic impact of printing on the manuscript tradition, and Singapore’s role as the early Malay/Muslim printing hub for the region.

The exhibition features precious manuscripts on loan from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, shown in Singapore for the first time. It is a unique opportunity to see these collections together.

Highlights include a manuscript (copied in 1710) of one of the oldest existing _syair_ (narrative poem), which tells of the war (1666–69) between the Dutch and Makassar; the earliest manuscript on the exploits of the legendary Malay hero, Hang Tuah; one of the most ornate Malay manuscripts; and an 1811 letter from the sultan of Pontianak in Kalimantan to Stamford Raffles.

Come, discover these and other fascinating stories.

18 August 2017 – 25 February 2018

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Singapore was the hub of Malay film production. Some of these films feature stories similar to those in handwritten Malay manuscripts. This display features snippets of seven such films, including _Sultan Mahmud Mangkat di-Julang_ and _Dang Anom_, with accompanying film magazines.

Jointly organised by the National Library of Singapore and Asian Film Archive.

#### **TALK | Art and Artists in Malay Manuscript Books**
**Friday, 18 August 2017
7.00pm – 8.00pm
Level 16, The Pod
Speaker: Datuk Dr Annabel Teh Gallop
_This talk is conducted in English_**

The art of the Malay book is primarily a religious art, and the finest examples of manuscript illumination in Southeast Asia are found not in literary or historical works, but in copies of the Qur’an. Sumptuously illuminated Qur’ans were produced in certain artistic centres such as Terengganu and Patani on the east coast of the Malay peninsula, Aceh on the northern tip of Sumatra, and across the archipelago from Java to Sulawesi and the island of Sumbawa.

Almost without exception, these exquisite works of art were anonymous, for Malay artists did not traditionally sign their artworks. However, in one finely illuminated Malay literary manuscript from the British Library currently on display in this exhibition – a copy of the _Hikayat Nabi Yusuf_, ‘The Story of the Prophet Joseph’, written in Perlis in 1802 – the artist has inscribed his own name, and his comments and annotations shed valuable light on the mechanics of the book trade in the Malay peninsula in the early 19th century.

Join Dr Annabel Gallop in this talk as she shares about the illumination of Qur’ans and other Islamic manuscripts.

She obtained her doctorate at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, in 2002 with the thesis, ‘Malay Seal Inscriptions: A Study in Islamic Epigraphy from Southeast Asia’. Her main research interests are Malay manuscripts, letters, documents and seals, and the art of the Qur’an in Southeast Asia.

#### **TALK | The Script State (Negeri Naskhah) – Malay Manuscripts in Documenting Memories**
**Saturday, 30 September 2017
3.00pm – 4.00pm
Level 5, Possibility Room
Speaker: Dr Azhar Ibrahim
_This talk is conducted in English_**

Manuscripts are testaments of their time, as they reflect the conditions and people surrounding the text. Today, the reception of manuscripts and texts – the way we read and interpret them – is also subject to the prevailing ideas of our time.

This programme provides an overview of the written tradition of the Malay world, which we have inherited in the form of manuscripts. Discover the stories of these texts; their various forms throughout history; and how the written text has become a symbol of power, intellect and mastery.

**Azhar Ibrahim** is a lecturer at the Department of Malay Studies, National University of Singapore. His research interests include sociology of religion, sociology of literature and critical literacy, and the Malay-Indonesia intellectual development.

#### **TALK | Hang Tuah in a Time of Independence: Malay Texts in the 1950s and 1960s**
**Saturday, 21 October 2017
2.00pm – 3.00pm
Level 5, Possibility Room
Speaker: Associate Professor Timothy P. Barnard
_This talk will be conducted in English_**

One of the great heroes of the Malay world, the legend of Hang Tuah centres on loyalty to family, friends and the ruler. The legend is found in numerous accounts in various manuscripts over the past 400 years. This talk will trace the development of Hang Tuah’s image in the original source materials through to comics and film in the mid-20th century. In the modern genres of literature, Hang Tuah’s loyalty to the sultan – a symbol of traditional subservience – becomes controversial, making his role ambivalent. This development is particularly significant during a period in which colonialism, loyalty and individualism became contested values as Singapore and Malaya moved towards independence.

**Timothy P. Barnard** is an associate professor in the Department of History, National University of Singapore. His research has focused on a range of topics including state formation in the 18th-century Strait of Melaka, Malay identity throughout history, Malay film in the 1950s and Singapore’s environmental history.

**Saturday, 25 November 2017

Speaker: Associate Professor Hadijah Bte Rahmat
_This talk will be conducted in Malay_**

Professor Hadijah Rahmat will discuss the manuscripts and early Malay books found in the United States (US) and Europe, where there are precious collections on Malay literary culture. These were gathered by Christian missionaries, scholars as well as European and American colonial officers. Learn about Professor Hadijah’s experiences in examining manuscripts and early Malay printings held at institutions such as the Library of Congress (US), Leiden University (Netherlands) and the University of Cambridge (United Kingdom).

**Hadijah bte Rahmat** is the deputy head of the Asian Languages and Cultures Academic Group, National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University. She is also the head of the Malay Language Council of Singapore and of MASTERA (Majlis Sastera Asia Tenggara) Singapore.

#### **WORKSHOP | I Can Compose and Recite _Syair!_**
**Saturday, 3 February 2018
9.30am – 11.00am
Level 5, Imagination Room
_Facilitators: Dr Sa’eda Buang and Dr Kartini Anwar
This workshop will be conducted in English and Malay. Participants must understand and be able to speak simple Malay_**

_Syair_ is a form of traditional Malay poetry that is made up of quatrains. Unlike another poetic form, _pantun_, each line of every stanza in _syair_ contributes to the formation of a unified idea or story.

Participants will be introduced to the functions and basic features of _syair_. They will also encounter various melodious forms of syair recitations based on the content and intent of the _syair_. Look forward to composing at least two verses of _syair_ and reciting them!

#### **TALK | Lithography and the Malay Manuscript Tradition**
**Saturday, 24 February 2018
11.00am – 12.00pm
Level 5, Possibility Room
Speaker: Prof Edwin P. Wieringa 
_This talk will be conducted in English_**

The technique of lithography enabled the Malay manuscript tradition to continue in the modern age, allowing for mass-produced printed texts. The _Syair Unggas Bersoal-Jawab_ (Poem of the Debating Birds) is among the 10 most frequently reissued titles of Singapore Malay Muslim printing in the second half of the 19th century.

Join Prof. Edwin P. Wieringa as he discusses this once-popular Malay poem, which in scholarly literature has been dismissed as a poor and pale reflection of Attar’s world-famous 12th-century Persian _Conference of the Birds_.

**Edwin P. Wieringa** is Professor of Indonesian Philology with Special Reference to Islamic Cultures at the University of Cologne, Germany.
