Advertisements are fascinating cultural documents that both shape and reflect people’s desires and ideals. This exhibition features advertising materials from the 1830s to 1960s in the National Library collection, and explores the hopes, dreams, aspirations and insecurities of society over the years.

Modelled after a department store, the exhibition highlights advertisements promoting a myriad of products, services and brands that once saturated Singapore’s busy consumer market. Through this colourful showcase of the National Library’s rare publications, magazines, newspapers and ephemera, you will gain a deeper understanding of advertising and its impact on society, while learning more about Singapore’s past.

#### **Talk | Selling Dreams | Selling Utopia: The Good Life as a Commodity in Singapore’s Early Advertisements**
**Date: 2 Feb 2019
Time: 2.00pm – 3.15pm
Venue: Level 5, Possibility Room, National Library Building**
<i>Free admission.</i> <i style="color:red;">(Programme has ended, registration is closed.)</i>

From the pre-modern to contemporary periods, Singapore has had a vibrant history of being imagined as a utopia. Most of these were top-down political narratives, but it was with the onset of print media that utopia began to be packaged as a commodity. Focusing on print advertisements from the late 19th and early centuries, this talk will examine specific imaginings of the Singapore Dream. In doing so, it aims to unveil the underlying prevailing worldviews that dominated these periods, while also making the case that the study of popular culture is serious business.

This session will also feature a short 15-minute presentation by SUTD students about their digital exhibits for ‘Selling Dreams: Early Advertising in Singapore’.

##### **About the Speaker**
**Dr Nazry Bahrawi** is senior lecturer at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). As a literary critic, he specialises in the comparative study of Muslim texts, thoughts and traditions of Indian Ocean cultures between Southeast Asia and the Middle East.

#### **Talk | Selling Dreams | Japanese Brand Presence in Singapore Since the 19th Century**
**Date: 19 Feb 2019
Time: 7.00pm – 8.30pm
Venue: Level 5, Possibility Room, National Library Building**
<i>Free admission.</i> <i style="color:red;">(Programme has ended, registration is closed.)</i>

It is generally thought that Japanese products and services were only present in Singapore from the 1940s onwards. However, there is evidence of Japanese brand presence in Singapore’s “Little Japan” (spanning Hylam, Malabar and Malay streets) from as early as the 19th century. Advertisements from the 1830s to 1930s publicising Japanese curios, stores, dentists, photographers, hotels, masseuses and even a fishing pond all point to the presence of Japanese products and services in early Singapore.

Join Peter Ling as he shares part of his fascinating research on Japanese advertising in Singapore between the 19th and 21st centuries.

##### **About the Speaker**
**Peter Ling** was an advertising practitioner and president of the Association of Accredited Advertising Agents in Singapore before working in the cities of Taipei, Perth and Melbourne. He is the author of _[Be the Innovators](https://www.oup.com.au/books/higher-education/management-and-marketing/9780195590173-be-the-innovators)_ as well as the lead author of _[Consumer Behaviour in Action](https://www.oup.com.au/books/higher-education/management-and-marketing/9780195525601-consumer-behaviour-in-action)_, both published by Oxford University Press (OUP). His third title, _Integrated Marketing Communication: A balanced approach_ (OUP), will be published in mid-2019. He is currently a Visiting Fellow at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

#### **Talk | Selling Dreams | Decoding Advertisements: The Semiotics of Print Advertisements**
**Date: 23 Feb 2019
Time: 2.00pm – 3.00pm
Venue: Level 5, Possibility Room, National Library Building**
<i>Free admission.</i> <i style="color:red;">(Programme has ended, registration is closed.)</i>

Product advertisements, in essence, are created to offer consumers choices. They persuade us to give ourselves a chance to transform ourselves – and our lives – for the better, through the simple act of choosing to purchase something. The addiction to buying and consumption leads to consumerism as a means to obtain a better life by way of capitalism.

But what lay beneath consumerism in the early settlement of Singapore? In this dialogue, Olivia will share about the significance of the images and text behind the design of print advertisements from early Singapore.

##### **About the Speaker**
**Jessica Olivia** earned her Master Degree in Arts (Design) in 2007 and has 10 years of industry experience as an Art Director at various advertising agencies under her belt. In the course of her creative career, Olivia has translated strategic thinking into big ideas. She is a firm believer of using good design fundamentals in her teaching delivery and many of her students have gone on to become successful designers. She is currently teaching at School of Design Communication, LASALLE College of the Arts.
