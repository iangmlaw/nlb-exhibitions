[**Turn of the tortoise: The challenge and promise of India’s future**](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=202846465){:target="_blank"}

Climbing from being the 12th largest economy in 2008 to the 7th largest in 2015, India’s growth in the past decade has often been cited as a natural counter-weight to China. Using extensive data to support his analysis, the author explores the paradox of a “premature superpower” (as Martin Wolf once described India in the *Financial Times*), and considers the social, economic and political forces that helped the rise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as well as the risks of constitutional liberalism yielding space to an illiberal democracy.

Bimal Jalan’s formidable analysis of the last four decades of India’s economic journey illuminates the nation’s transition from a strictly regulated, slow-growth state enterprise to one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Drawing on the author’s vast experience in financial governance, Jalan compares two distinct periods – 1980 to 2000 and 2000 to 2015 – to examine the core changes and their significance, and considers their lessons for the immediate future.
