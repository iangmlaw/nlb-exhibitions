[**The Future of Mobility: Scenarios for China in 2030**](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/Main/Browse?startsWith=P){:target="_blank"}

A team of researchers have developed two scenarios to envision the future of mobility in China in 2030. Economic growth, constraints on vehicle ownership and driving, and environmental conditions differentiate the scenarios. By making potential long-term mobility futures more vivid, the team aims to help decision-makers in government and the private sector better anticipate and prepare for change.

[**Why cycling matters for electric mobility: Towards diverse, active and sustainable e-Mobilities**](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17450101.2017.1335463){:target="_blank"}

The paper proposes the concept of e-velomobility, and explores practices, systems and technologies of electrically assisted cycling – in which velomobility’s pedal power combines with e-mobility’s battery/motor assistance to propel the rider. The concept draws on research and policies centred on e-mobility, velomobility and e-bikes. Also presented are studies in China on e-mobility, velomobility and e-bikes.
