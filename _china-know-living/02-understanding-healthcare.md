[**Coping with regional inequality in healthcare in China**](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=13712512){:target="_blank"}

This publication sheds light on the regional inequality in China’s healthcare system, which is a consequence of the disparate availability of health financing and health resources between the rural and urban areas. To address this, the central government has supplemented funding for basic health services and increased subsidies for health service providers in less affluent regions of China.

**China’s “barefoot” doctors**

This video looks at the “barefoot” doctors’ network established in rural China during Mao Zedong’s era. Working alongside farmers, these non-medically trained doctors, or village doctors, provide basic health care to fellow villagers even up to today, despite the abolishment of the barefoot doctor programme during economic reforms that took place during the 1980s.

[**China’s dire need to reform health care sector seen as opportunity for private hospitals**](http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2076196/chinas-dire-need-reform-health-care-sector-seen-opportunity){:target="_blank"}

According to analysts, China’s public healthcare system –which has to cope with an increasing number of diseases related to ageing and pollution – is severely in need of reform, and this is where the private hospital sector can come in to help ease the heavy workload of public hospitals. Policies, such as reducing the red tape for setting up private hospitals and allowing these hospitals to determine their own medical fees, could incentivise the setting up of more of such private hospitals.
